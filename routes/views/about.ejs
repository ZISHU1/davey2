  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Davey Gravy is a commercial photographer and videographer based in Calgary, Canada. Through my life I have always found beauty in the world around me. I began my creative career in visual arts by attending and graduating from Alberta College of Art + Design. Since then, I have found my home in photography and videography. Iâ€™ve been fortunate to travel locally and abroad with clients to share stories and capture beauty.
  </p>
  <p>
    I aim to tell authentic stories through everything I do, by creating natural-feeling content with a hint of documentary style and a unique and meaningful approach. Being trained as a multidisciplinary artist has encouraged me to explore different mediums, overcome challenges, and take risks to create something memorable.
